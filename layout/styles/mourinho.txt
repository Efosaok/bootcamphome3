MOURINHO,MAYBE,MAYBE NOT

 Jose Mourinho has been appointed as manager of manchester united!.this news no doubt brought solace to aggrieved united fans who have endured disappointments from
managers who failed to live up to expectation,the unrivaled king of english football has actually experienced a relapse in performance since the departure Sir Ferguson
failing to qualify yet again for the champions league,during the just concluded seson ,I met with various united fans and i managed to take a jot of what they think 
was the problem and what the solution could be;
              
                          "our manager does not inspire the team,all he does is sit and 
                           write,taking jots that does not change anything."
                                       their solution:
                           "we need a coach that will increase the team spirit.increase
                            the players morale,a diego simeone is neeeded."

                            "the manager is inconsistent,today,rooney is a centre forward,
                             next week he is asupporting striker,tommorrow he is a no.four
                             defensive midfielder,the players do not understand their roles,"
                                   their solution:
                            "team co-ordination and stability is needed.do not experiment 
                             with the players on match day,just give us the results."

CAN MOURINHO LIVE UP TO EXPECTATION AND RECLAIM LOST PRIDE
Jose mourinho arguably is the most widely celebrated coach in football history,being a versatile strategist that can use any tacical means on the pitch as long as he
gets good results,that said,we also have to acknowledge that he is not met with the best situation on ground,looking at the man united's squad,the attackers are a 
selction of talented youngsters trying to make a mark in the footballing world,and mourinho times without number have shown that he does not work with youngsters,a 
manager
